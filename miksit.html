                <h2>Project Overview</h2>

                <p>
                    As Senior Product Designer at Meeco, I led the design for
                    mIKs-it – a digital media application providing a secure and
                    safe environment for children that is inclusive for those
                    with developmental or physical disabilities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I worked as the lead designer on this 6-month project
                    co-developed by Meeco and Heder, a school for special needs
                    children in Belgium. Our delivery team included a product
                    owner, CTO, front-end engineer, and back-end engineer from
                    Meeco, with the discovery phase led by Trendwolves, a
                    Belgian research company.
                </p>

                <h2>Understanding the Problem</h2>

                <p>
                    Heder approached us with a vision for a digital tool that
                    would provide a secure environment for children with special
                    needs to engage with personalised media content. Traditional
                    media applications weren't designed with the unique
                    requirements of these children in mind, presenting several
                    challenges:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Existing media platforms lacked appropriate
                        accessibility features for children with developmental
                        or physical disabilities
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Parents had privacy concerns about sharing their
                        children's media on commercial platforms
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Children with special needs often struggled with the
                        complex interfaces of standard media applications
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There was a need for a platform that could support
                        educational and therapeutic goals while being enjoyable
                        for children
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    We had an opportunity to create an application specifically
                    designed for children with varying abilities that would
                    provide a safe, accessible way to engage with personalised
                    media while giving parents complete control over content and
                    privacy.
                </p>

                <h2>Discovery Process</h2>
            </div>

            <img
                class="portfolio-image"
                src="images/miksit-discovery.png"
                alt="mIKs-it Discovery"
            />

            <div class="inset">
                <p>
                    The discovery phase was led by Trendwolves, with whom I
                    collaborated closely. We conducted comprehensive user
                    research with 7 test families having children of various
                    ages and needs. Through in-depth interviews, surveys, and
                    observation sessions, we developed 6 distinct personas
                    representing different user types.
                </p>

                <p>Our research revealed several key insights:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Children with special needs showed distinct engagement
                        patterns with digital content compared to neurotypical
                        children
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Personalised content featuring family members and
                        familiar environments created the strongest engagement
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Different content types (photos, videos, audio) served
                        different developmental purposes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Parents needed granular control over content sharing and
                        permissions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Simple, intuitive interfaces with minimal text were
                        essential for children's independent use
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The application needed to support both entertainment and
                        educational/therapeutic uses
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    These findings shaped our user stories from both child and
                    parent perspectives. Children needed an engaging, accessible
                    interface they could navigate independently, while parents
                    required robust content management and sharing controls.
                </p>

                <h2>Design Process</h2>
            </div>

            <img
                class="portfolio-image"
                src="images/miksit-wireframes.png"
                alt="mIKs-it Wireframes"
            />

            <div class="inset">
                <p>
                    My approach followed a user-centred design process with
                    accessibility as a core principle:
                </p>

                <p>
                    I co-created wireframes with Heder and Trendwolves through
                    collaborative workshop sessions. Together, we developed
                    wireframes for both the children's application (mIKs-it
                    Kids) and the parent administration application (mIKs-it
                    Admin). These wireframes focused on creating distinct
                    experiences tailored to each user group – a highly visual,
                    intuitive interface for children and a comprehensive
                    management tool for parents.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The children's interface demanded particular attention to
                    accessibility. A critical constraint was that the kids app
                    had to work with accessibility devices for children who
                    couldn't use physical touch inputs. I worked closely with
                    our engineering team and Heder's accessibility experts to
                    design UI that would work comfortably for all users.
                </p>

                <p>Together, we established key design principles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        High contrast visuals with vibrant buttons against dark
                        backgrounds
                    </li>
                    <li>Consistent, large interactive elements</li>
                    <li>Simple navigation without text prompts</li>
                    <li>
                        Predictable response patterns to support different
                        cognitive abilities
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tab selection from left to right for integration with
                        alternate input devices like switches
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    For the mIKs-it Admin application, we created wireframes for
                    the core functionality:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Content management in the gallery</li>
                    <li>Child profile management</li>
                    <li>Contact management and permissions</li>
                    <li>Settings and notifications</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    These wireframes were refined through collaborative
                    workshops with stakeholders from both Meeco and Heder. I
                    then developed high-fidelity designs for key sections,
                    creating a cohesive visual language across both applications
                    while maintaining their distinct purposes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    During the build phase, we followed an agile development
                    approach with 3-week sprints, allowing us to rapidly iterate
                    based on stakeholder feedback. I worked closely with our
                    engineering team to ensure technical feasibility while
                    maintaining the integrity of the design vision.
                </p>

                <h2>The Solution</h2>

                <p>
                    mIKs-it consists of two interconnected applications – a
                    children's interface (mIKs-it Kids) and a parent
                    administration tool (mIKs-it Admin) – supported by a
                    sophisticated backend architecture.
                </p>

                <h3>mIKs-it Kids</h3>

                    The children's application provides a streamlined,
                    accessible experience with these key features:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Profile Selection</strong>: Allows multiple
                        children to share a device with personalised content for
                        each
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Grid View</strong>: The main interface
                        presenting a visual array of available media
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Media Categorisation</strong>: Simple filtering
                        for photos, videos, and audio content
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Game Mode</strong>: Interactive experiences
                        customised for different ability levels

                    <li>
                        <strong>Intuitive Navigation</strong>: Large touch
                        targets and consistent interaction patterns
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The interface uses minimal text, relying instead on clear
                    iconography and visual cues. The dark background with
                    vibrant content creates high contrast for improved
                    accessibility, while the consistent layout helps children
                    develop familiarity and confidence.

                <h2>Outcomes</h2>

                <p>
                    The mIKs-it prototype was distributed to five families for
                    testing, with positive results:
                </p>

                <p>
                    Parents reported that children of all abilities quickly
                    learned to navigate the application independently. Children
                    with special needs showed particular engagement with content
                    featuring themselves and family members, often using the app
                    to initiate communication about what they were seeing.
                </p>

                <p>Key observations from the research included:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Children remained highly focused when using the
                        application, even with background distractions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The application facilitated memory recall and
                        storytelling for children with communication challenges
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Siblings often used the app together, creating new
                        opportunities for interaction
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Parents appreciated the safety and privacy features
                        compared to commercial platforms
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Families saw potential for supporting developmental
                        goals beyond simple entertainment
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    All test families expressed interest in continuing to use
                    mIKs-it beyond the testing period, with parents noting its
                    value for creating meaningful engagement and supporting
                    communication development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The proof-of-concept demonstrated clear value for both
                    Heder's existing community and potential wider market
                    applications. The project validated not just the technical
                    feasibility but the genuine impact of a purpose-built media
                    platform for children with special needs.
