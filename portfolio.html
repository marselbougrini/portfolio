                            Allie is a performance management platform that transforms how allied health clinics track and manage practitioner success. As Senior Product Designer at Growthbox, I led the complete design vision for this SaaS solution, working as the sole designer on a 9-month MVP project.

                            The Monocular API is an advanced computer vision service that enables developers to integrate sophisticated visual recognition capabilities into their applications. As a solo designer for Jemsoft, I created a developer-focused dashboard that simplifies the typically complex process of API setup and management.

                        <p>
                            I designed an interface that guides users through API configuration, usage monitoring, and subscription management with clear visual feedback and intuitive workflows.

                            The Palamir Smart City Dashboard is a web-based platform that aggregates multiple data sources to provide city administrators with a comprehensive overview of urban infrastructure and public safety. As a solo designer, I was brought in after Palamir had built their initial prototype to transform their complex data visualisation into an intuitive, actionable interface.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I used strategic colour coding and iconography to help users quickly discover and interpret critical information across diverse data streams. The solution enhanced information discovery through thoughtful design, enabling city officials to monitor and respond to urban challenges more effectively.
