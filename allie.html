                <h2>Project Overview</h2>

                <p>
                    As Senior Product Designer at Growthbox, I led the design
                    for
                    <a href="https://allieclinics.com" target="_blank">Allie</a>
                    – a platform that transforms how allied health clinics track
                    and manage practitioner performance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I worked as the sole designer on this 9-month MVP project
                    for our client, Clinic Mastery. Our team included a product
                    owner from Clinic Mastery, plus our Growthbox crew: product
                    manager, lead engineer, two full-stack developers, and
                    customer support/QA.
                </p>

                <h2>Understanding the Problem</h2>

                <img
                    class="portfolio-image"
                    src="images/allie-problem.png"
                    alt="Allie old system"
                />

                <div class="inset">

                <p>
                    Clinic Mastery came to us with a challenge many allied
                    health clinics face. They had a Google Sheets performance
                    dashboard that worked, but had serious limitations.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Clinic owners were spending hours copying data from
                        their Patient Management Systems
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some were even hiring virtual assistants just to handle
                        data entry
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The spreadsheet required training to use effectively and
                        often contained errors
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The solution was only available to Clinic Mastery's
                        coaching clients
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The goal was to create something that would
                    eliminate manual work, provide real-time insights, and
                    expand market reach through a self-service SaaS model.
                </p>

                <h2>Discovery Process</h2>
            </div>

            <img
                class="portfolio-image"
                src="images/allie-discovery.png"
                alt="Allie Discovery"
            />

            <div class="inset">
                <p>
                    I organised four discovery workshops over a month, bringing
                    together our Growthbox team and Clinic Mastery stakeholders.
                    Between workshops, I conducted user interviews with clinic
                    owners and domain experts from Clinic Mastery.
                </p>

                <p>These conversations revealed key insights:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Many clinics tie practitioner performance directly to
                        financial incentives
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Clinic owners needed tools to mentor their team and
                        recognise high performers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Practitioners wanted visibility into their own metrics
                        and financial incentives without seeing sensitive team
                        data
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cliniko was the dominant Patient Management System among
                        users
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    We developed two personas (clinic owner and practitioner)
                    and crafted user stories from both perspectives. This helped
                    us understand the different needs and privacy considerations
                    for each user type.
                </p>

                <h2>Design Process</h2>
            </div>

            <img
                class="portfolio-image"
                src="images/allie-wireframes.png"
                alt="Allie Wireframes"
            />

            <div class="inset">

                <p>
                    I started with wireframes focusing on key user tasks and
                    data visualisation. Testing these with clinic owners and
                    practitioners gave us feedback that shaped subsequent
                    iterations. As the design evolved, I created Figma prototypes to test more complex interactions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Working with our engineering team, we chose MUI as
                    our design system foundation. I built a comprehensive UI kit in Figma based on MUI for consistency.
                </p>

                <p>Together we established key design principles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Clear visual hierarchy showing important insights
                        immediately
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Separation of data access between owners and
                        practitioners
                    </li>
                    <li>Automation of manual processes wherever possible</li>
                    <li>
                        Flexible layouts supporting different device sizes and
                        clinic types
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Data visualisation that highlights trends and
                        opportunities
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    We followed an agile process with two-week sprints. I
                    actively participated in sprint planning sessions with our
                    engineers, helping prioritise features based on user value
                    and technical complexity. Regular design reviews with both
                    Growthbox and Clinic Mastery teams kept everyone aligned. I
                    also contributed to quarterly strategic check-ins to ensure
                    we were meeting longer-term goals.
                </p>

                <h2>The Solution</h2>

                <p>
                    Allie connects directly to Cliniko via API, automatically
                    importing and visualising performance data. But we didn't
                    just build a dashboard – we created a tool that transforms
                    how clinics approach performance management.
                </p>

                <h3>Clinic Owner Dashboard</h3>

            <div class="inset">
                <p>
                    The clinic owner interface provides comprehensive management
                    capabilities:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Team Benchmarking</strong>: Compare practitioner
                        performance across key metrics
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Target Setting</strong>: Establish goals based
                        on historical performance
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Incentive Management</strong>: Configure
                        financial incentives tied to performance
                    </li>

                        <strong>Data Analysis</strong>: Identify trends and
                        opportunities for improvement
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The interface provides a clear visual hierarchy that shows
                    important insights immediately, while allowing users to dig
                    deeper when needed.

                    One key innovation was creating separate logins for clinic
                    owners and practitioners. This enabled transparency while
                    maintaining privacy – practitioners can now see their own
                    metrics and incentive progress without accessing sensitive
                    information about colleagues.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The practitioner interface focuses on individual
                    performance:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Personal Metrics</strong>: Track individual
                        performance against targets
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Incentive Tracking</strong>: Monitor progress
                        towards financial incentives
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Historical Trends</strong>: View performance
                        over time to identify patterns
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Goal Setting</strong>: Set personal targets
                        aligned with clinic objectives
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Self-assessment</strong>: Tools to reflect on

                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    We also leveraged automation in several ways. Daily imports
                    from Cliniko eliminated the fortnightly manual updates,
                    while our target-setting feature analyses historical data to
                    suggest appropriate benchmarks for clinic owners.

                <p>
                    Within the first month of launch, Allie secured 32 paying
                    subscribers. The feedback from clinic owners was overwhelmingly positive.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Several clinics have eliminated virtual assistant positions
                    previously needed for spreadsheet maintenance. Performance
                    reviews that used to take hours now take minutes to prepare.
                    Practitioners are showing increased ownership of their
                    results with real-time visibility into their performance and
                    incentives.

                    Our MVP launch was just the beginning. During discovery, we
                    identified two clear areas for future iterations: a document
                    resource hub and tools to help clinics with NDIS (National
