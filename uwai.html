                <h2>Project Overview</h2>

                <p>
                    As Lead Product Designer, I led the design update for UWAI, a platform that helps people save money through discounted gift cards from over 3,000 merchants.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I worked as the sole designer on this 8-month project for UWAI. Our team included a product manager, mobile developer, and I partnered with a marketing agency to help navigate user research with UWAI's primarily Chinese speaking user base.
                </p>

                <h2>Understanding the Problem</h2>

                <img
                    class="portfolio-image"
                    src="images/uwai-old-system.png"
                    alt="UWAI old system"
                />

                <div class="inset">

                <p>
                    When I started working on UWAI, they had about 3,000 users and a functional app, but they faced challenges growing user engagement and revenue.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Users were struggling with the cumbersome process of actually using purchased gift cards, despite the app making it easy to buy new ones
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Monthly active users sat at about 678 (21% of their total user base)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The original design treated each gift card purchase as an isolated transaction, but user behavior suggested they wanted something different
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The goal was to increase user signups, boost revenue, and transform UWAI from an occasional-use app into an everyday savings tool.
                </p>

                <h2>Discovery Process</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="inset">
                <p>
                    Working with UWAI's primarily Chinese speaking user base presented unique research challenges. I partnered with a local Chinese focused marketing agency that could engage directly with users to conduct interviews, user testing, and gather feedback over 2 months.
                </p>

                <p>Through this research, we uncovered the following insights:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Most of UWAI's active users consistently bought supermarket gift cards, particularly from Coles and Woolworths
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Despite the modest 4% discount, when used consistently throughout the year, some users were saving around $600 annually on groceries – a significant household budget impact
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The existing app emphasized purchasing new gift cards but made it cumbersome to use cards that had already been purchased
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Users wanted quick access to their favorite brands and a wallet-like experience for everyday use
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    I also researched successful membership models and came across a compelling case study on Costco. Their paid membership not only drives revenue but creates a perception of premium value among customers – something we wanted to explore for UWAI.
                </p>

                <h2>Design Process</h2>
            </div>

            <img
            <img
                class="portfolio-image"
                src="images/uwai-discovery.png"
                alt="UWAI Wireframes"
            />

            <div class="inset">

                <p>
                    I started by reimagining the core user experience around brands rather than individual transactions. The key insight was shifting from a purchase-focused interface to a brand-centric experience that aligned with how enthusiastic users actually wanted to use the product.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Working closely with the product manager and mobile developer, we established key design principles:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Brand-first navigation with users able to save favorite brands to their home screen for quick access
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Integrated wallet experience where users could view existing gift cards and purchase new ones from the same interface
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Everyday utility positioning to shift perception from occasional use to daily savings tool
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Premium subscription model inspired by Costco's membership psychology
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Seamless user flows that eliminated friction between viewing, using, and purchasing gift cards
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    We followed an iterative approach with continuous testing through our marketing agency partners. For 2 months, we tested and refined designs with UWAI's user base before finalizing the interface and updating the app.
                </p>

                <h2>The Solution</h2>

                <p>
                    UWAI v2 introduced a fundamentally different approach to gift card management, transforming the experience from transactional to relationship-based.
                </p>

                <h3>Brand-Centric Home Screen</h3>
            </div>

            <img
                class="portfolio-image"
                src="images/uwai-brands.png"
                alt="UWAI Brand Screens"
            />

            <div class="inset">
                <p>
                    The redesigned home screen allows users to save their favorite brands for instant access. This created a personalized dashboard that prioritized the brands users actually care about, rather than showing a generic catalog of all available options.
                </p>

                <p>
                    From each brand tile, users can access their complete relationship with that brand – existing gift cards, purchase history, and new purchase options – all in one integrated experience.
                </p>

                <h3>Unified Wallet Interface</h3>
            </div>

            <img
                class="portfolio-image"
                src="images/uwai-wallet.png"
                alt="UWAI Wallet Screens"
            />

            <div class="inset">
                <p>
                    One key innovation was creating a wallet-style interface for each brand. Users can now see all their existing gift cards for a specific brand in one place, with clear balance and expiry information. Tapping on a gift card activates it for immediate use.
                </p>
            </div>

                <img
                class="portfolio-image"
                src="images/uwai-cards.png"
                alt="UWAI Gift Card Screens"
            />
            
            <div class="inset">
                <p>
                    The wallet interface also handles new purchases seamlessly – users can buy additional gift cards without leaving the brand context, making it feel like topping up a wallet rather than making separate transactions.
                </p>

                <h3>VIP Subscription Model</h3>
            </div>

            <img
                class="portfolio-image"
                src="images/uwai-vip.png"
                alt="UWAI VIP Screens"
            />

            <div class="inset">
                <p>
                    Inspired by Costco's membership psychology, we introduced a VIP subscription tier at $1.99 per month. This provided users with higher discount rates, better payment options, and created a perception of premium value while generating recurring revenue for UWAI.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The subscription model tapped into the psychology that paid memberships make users feel like they're getting exclusive access and better deals.
                </p>

            </div>

            <img
                class="portfolio-image"

                alt="UWAI Features"
            />

            <div class="inset">

                <h2>Outcomes</h2>

                <p>
                    Within 6 months of launch, UWAI v2 saw significant growth across key metrics.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The user base grew from 3,225 to 4,939 users – a 53% increase. Monthly active users jumped from 678 to 980, representing a 45% improvement in engagement. Monthly revenue grew from $190,739 to $223,708, including 400 new paid VIP subscribers - a 17% increase in monthly recurring revenue.
                </p>


                <h2>Future Opportunities</h2>

            </div>

            <img
                class="portfolio-image"
                src="images/uwai-teamperks.png"
                alt="UWAI TeamPerks"
            />

            <div class="inset">

                <p>
                    During the v2 rollout, we identified potential in the corporate benefits space. We developed TeamPerks – a B2B version of UWAI where HR departments could provide staff access to a customized version as an employee perk.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We've successfully signed 3 corporate clients in early beta testing. This B2B strategy represents significant growth potential, with the team excited to continue pursuing enterprise opportunities while strengthening the consumer platform.
